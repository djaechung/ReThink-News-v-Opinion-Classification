# ReThink-News-v-Opinion-Classification

Contains the work of a 2021 research colaboration between UC Berkeley and ReThink Media to develop classifiers for news coverage bias analysis of the 2020 election. One team worked to classify the genders of article authors while another team worked to classify whether a given article was news or opinion. This repository is a public copy of the original private repository. It contains the code for the news-v-opinion classifiers only.

Contents:
* `Data` - contains preliminary and cleaned data, data cleaning scripts. Authorization was not granted to share article or author data, thus only data cleaning scripts are included in this public repository
* `Models` - contains implementations of the news-v-opinion classifiers developed by the UC Berkeley team, but not that of the gender classification team
* `Research_Report.pdf` - contains the blog post describing this work and the results of the team's classification models
